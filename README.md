# EUR/USD Pice Prediction 
In this project, we aim to predict the future price of the currency exchange rate of Euro (EUR) and US Dollar (USD) using time series analysis and forecasting techniques. Time series analysis is a statistical approach that is used to analyze the data that varies over time, such as stock prices, exchange rates, and weather patterns. By analyzing the historical data of the EUR/USD exchange rate, we can identify trends, patterns, and seasonality, which can then be used to make predictions about future values. In this project, we will use advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that can provide accurate and reliable forecasts. Our goal is to provide valuable insights and predictions to assist traders, investors, and market participants in making informed decisions regarding the EUR/USD exchange rate.
